# fs-vis-click
FieldScope Visualization Redesign UX Prototype. Created June 2024 by Ben Loh.


# FieldScope Visualization Workflow Clickable Prototype

`fs-viz-click` is a thin UI prototype used to inform the design of a new reworking of the existing FieldScope UI circa June 2024.

(`fs-viz-prototype` in contrast was the "R"-inspired version that emulated a data science workflow.)
